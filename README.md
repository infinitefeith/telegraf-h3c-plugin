# H3C Model-Driven Telemetry (MDT) Input Plugin
H3C model-driven telemetry (MDT) is an input plugin that consumes telemetry
data from H3C comware platforms. It supports GRPC dialout transports.  
RPC-based transport can utilize TLS for authentication and encryption.  
Telemetry data is expected to be GPB-KV (self-describing-gpb) encoded.
